# GKP states project
Optimal generation of optical quantum resources:
Linear optical quantum computation requires efficient use of routines based on probabilistic quantum measurements. In this project, 
we combine computational approaches for simulating optical quantum computers with machine learning in an attempt to improve the processing
of optical quantum information.
